# Facial Recognition Python Project
Overview
This is a Python-based facial recognition system that leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect and recognize human faces from images or video streams. The project uses popular Python libraries, including face_recognition, OpenCV, and dlib, to provide real-time facial detection and recognition capabilities.

The system can be used for various applications, including security systems, access control, and automating interactions based on facial identity. This project is built with scalability and performance in mind, offering the ability to detect multiple faces in images and video streams with minimal computational overhead.

# Features
Real-time Face Detection: Detect faces in images or videos with real-time performance.
Face Recognition: Recognize known faces and match them to a database of images.
Face Landmark Detection: Detect facial landmarks such as eyes, nose, mouth, and chin for advanced applications.
Multiple Face Support: Handle detection of multiple faces in a single image or video stream.
Cross-platform Support: Designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

Python 3.7 or higher
A virtual environment (optional, but recommended)
pip (Python package manager) for installing dependencies
A webcam or an image file for face detection
# Libraries and Tools
The project uses the following libraries:

face_recognition: A simple face recognition library that provides high-level APIs for face detection, recognition, and manipulation.
OpenCV: A popular computer vision library that allows image and video processing.
dlib: A toolkit for machine learning and computer vision, including face recognition.
numpy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.

# Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project environment and install necessary dependencies.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

bash

Copy

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-recognition-project.git

cd facial-recognition-project

Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional)

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects. You can set up a virtual environment as follows:

For macOS/Linux:
bash

Copy

python3 -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate

For Windows:

bash
Copy
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Use pip to install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, you can manually install the required packages:

bash
Copy
pip install face_recognition opencv-python dlib numpy Pillow
Step 4: Install Additional Dependencies for Face Recognition Models (if needed)
Sometimes, you may need to install the face recognition models:

bash
Copy
pip install git+https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition_models.git
Step 5: Verify the Installation
To verify that everything is set up correctly, run the following command to test the facial detection script:

bash
Copy
python main.py
If everything is installed correctly, it should output a confirmation like "Face detected!" or "No faces found," depending on the input provided.

# Usage
The facial recognition system can be used with both images and video streams. Below are instructions on how to use the system in different contexts.

Detect Faces from an Image
Place an image file in the project directory (or specify the full path to the image).
Run the script with the image as input:
bash
Copy
python detect_faces.py --image <image_path>
Example:

bash
Copy
python detect_faces.py --image ./images/sample_face.jpg
This will detect faces in the image and display the results in a window. If faces are detected, they will be outlined with bounding boxes.

# Real-Time Face Detection from Video Stream
For real-time face detection using your webcam, run the following command:

bash
Copy
python detect_faces.py --video
This will open a video window from your webcam and detect faces in real-time. Press q to exit the video stream.

Face Recognition
To use the face recognition feature (comparing detected faces with a known database), you will need to have images of known people. For example, you can have a folder of known faces stored in the known_faces/ directory.

Place the images of known people in the known_faces/ folder (each image should contain a single face).
Run the recognition script:
bash
Copy
python recognize_faces.py --video
This will detect faces from the video stream and try to match them with faces in the known_faces/ folder. The system will display the name of the recognized person next to their face.
